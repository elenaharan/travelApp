# TravelApp
The TravelApp application is bootstrapped with CRA version 5. It allows users to make a list of items that they need to pack to go on a holiday. They can also mark their items as packed or delete the items off the list. The users can also sort the items by the order of the items input, by the item description and packed status. The app also provides stats to the user by informing them how many items there are on the list, how many of those items have been packed and the percentage of items packed.
